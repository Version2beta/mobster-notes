# Mob Programming Retrospectives

## July 29, 2015

Today's mob was Julia (driver), Amanda, Rob, Caleb. Working on Julia's frontend code. 

*What went well? On a team level... For you personally...*
"there were things that i saw and learned", "i personally think it went better than i would've gone through by myself", "it seemed to go pretty well this time"


*What didn't go well? On a team level... For you personally...*
"i think some explanation at the beginning about the project"


*What would you like to try differently? On a team level... For you personally...*
"like what somebody suggested, maybe we can let one of the less experienced people drive, and there would be a navigator (more experienced) to navigate", "i think we can set some intention at the beginning of the mob, learning, or be more productive, or if one person is no way in the mood for mob then can't be a driver", "i still think rotating drivers can be better. but i don't know how to solve the individual preferences on key-bindings"


*What still has you puzzled? On a team level... For you personally...*
"i don't get how mobbing for more than 4 hours a day can be productive"

## July 16, 2015

Today's mob was Jason (code owner), Rob, Julia, Amanda, Kirsten, Michael, Arun, working on Bulk Nomination using AngularJS, Mocha, jsdom, $httpBackend, started on Sinon at the end.

*What went well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"Didn't have any keymapping issue", "I can see how using jsdom and $httpBackend may encounter problems during the testing phase"

*What didn't go well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"Not as productive as previous ones", "Coming in late, kinda put stuff on Jason's plate more, doesn't help the team on the team level. I can see that benefitting in mob programming who knows the problem and language would be more productive", "participation wasn't 100%, i don't know if it was expected in mob programming or not, but i didn't see that much participation in this mob session.", "yeah, maybe some of them got sidetracked, or perhaps this one was too much research and not enough coding", "nothing on this session, but i do feel that it'd be better for the participants to have some pre-research on the stuff", "usually trying to do research while in a mob group, is more time-consuming, and there's a chance that the group research may break apart, and leaving the driver hanging", "it's different for company projects is that not always interesting, the project is simply necessary".

*What would you like to try differently? On a team level... For you personally...*

"pre-research and knowing what people are getting into in the mob session", "maybe it didn't work so well because the participants weren't familiar with the project or framework", "if we treated more like an open source project, like an on-going project, so interest people who are actually familiar and interested in the project to participate", "the differences between now and that is we are forming mob programming because we want to form mob programming, not because people who are really interested in angular", "maybe it'll help when people download source code and work on it at the same time", "maybe we should create a war room for a specific problem with specific timeline" 

*What still has you puzzled? On a team level... For you personally...*

"nothing", "everything is crystal clear about mob programming"

## July 14, 2015

Today's mob was Michael Whitehead (facilitating and code owner), Jaswandi, Julia, Amanda, Ben, Jason, Rob, Amela (briefly), and Sowjanya (briefly).

*What went well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"I learned some Scala. I got an idea of the project. I wouldn't have been involved in the project or in Scala except for this mob. Otherwise I wouldn't have learned anything on this." ""We changed drivers. That was cool." "It's better for us to work as a team sometimes, even if we don't otherwise work on the same project. It's good for the team." "I didn't think I was going to be able to contribute. But I feel like I did, and I learned stuff too."

*What didn't go well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"I felt there was a lot of pressure on me. I was the only language expert, and the only one who knew the code." "The session was too short." "[Construction] It's noisy outside. Made it hard to hear. Made me anxious. Feels like a war zone today." "We need to mob more often." 

*What would you like to try differently? On a team level... For you personally...*

"It would be nice if everyone had setup on their laptops, so we don't have to deal with the peculiarities of someone else's system setup." "I'd like if we could invite other people who know the language, when we have only one person who knows it." "We need to mob more often." "I feel like we need to have more space." 

*What still has you puzzled? On a team level... For you personally...*

"Scala."

## 22 June 2015

*What went well? On a team level... For you personally...*

Today's mob was with Michael Whitehead (driving), Amanda Walter, Aaron Tracy, Julia Gao, Jason Hill, Lakshmi Boyina, and Rob Martin. We mobbed from 9 AM to 4 PM with an hour lunch and a presentation on our work at 4. We did a hack day today, "Recognition in the year 3000", and created a whuffie point product idea, implementing a Slack bot for identifying whuffie awards in a Slack channel.

"We did a really good job of bouncing off each other's ideas at the beginning of the day to come up with our solutions. I don't think it was any one person's ideas that got built."

"I think once we figured out what our idea was and what we were heading for, we all pulled together and worked on the solution. That's what was neat, seeing us all work together."

"We kicked butt. People loved our ideas and they were very complimentary of our work."

"We accomplished more in a short time. We built a project without much complexity. Because we worked together we built something simpler than we would have had we worked separately." "I second that, that's what I would have said."

"We got a more difficult Javascript library. That was a new idea that I can investigate more later."

"I learned a lot from this process. About libraries I'd never seen before. Some testing concepts. Even just refactoring the tests, to use a library that we weren't sure about. We weren't sure how it worked, so we refactored to understand the library better. Today we had a limited time frame, and the fact that we took the time to refactor is a definite positive."

*One thing I've heard is that mob programming results in less technical debt. Agree?* "I would agree." "I agree, and I think it goes along with what was said about the complexity because I kept getting pulled back a bunch of times from what I would have done, and I think what we ended up doing was a lot simpler." "I agree I think we end up with simpler code, so it's possible. It'd be nice to follow some projects over a longer time to be sure."

"It's nice that I'm not solely responsible for any bad code. There's shared responsibility for good and bad code." "I think that the result product will be less bad because there's got to be some better coders on the team. Teams with mixed levels of experience will turn out better code."

*What didn't go well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"I felt like sometimes when I said things, I shut people down. It feels like if everybody doesn't agree with you, you feel singled out."

"I was going to drive for a while, but I didn't speak up. I feel like I learn more from driving more." "It would have been fine for me if someone had jumped in to drive... If I wanted to step back and take a higher level view of the problem, it would have been good if someone else took over driving."

"We did really high level, difficult Javascript today, stuff I wasn't prepared to understand. There were a lot of times today I was scrambling to keep up, but the team kept moving because the people who were contributing most were able to keep up at the higher level." "It was a lot of learning for me because I don't know much about functional programming." "Did you feel excluded from the mob because you didn't know what was going on?" "Somewhat." "I feel like I learned a lot, one from reading the docs online and two from seeing how they used it. I think when we bring interns on in September it'll be really good because they can see how people actually implement the code, rather than just reading the docs." 

"I think it's interesting that there's one particular implementation that one person was pushing for, and that person might have felt like she lost that debate but that's the implementation we built."

*Power imbalance?* "Because this was a hack day, I feel like we needed to get more done. If we'd had more time, I would have stopped more to check if everyone know what was going on." "I noticed a few times that the driver would make a statement along the lines of 'This is my opinion but feel free to disagree.' I feel like that should be an implicit understanding, that every statement can and should be challenged."

*Tight deadline:* "I think that went well, we did get a lot done. We got a good amount accomplished, we just didn't do a lot of learning and training so that next time we meet everyone could participate better." "On the plus side, I think we did a pretty good job of estimating what we could get to in the time we had." 

"Especially for those who don't know the language well, it's easier for them to feel excluded and shut down and even hurt or upset because they don't feel competent already, like 'I don't know the language and now I can't contribute in other ways either.' I think in future mobs we need to encourage them more, to make their competence level go up, and explain why we think this or that idea may not work."

*Who is responsible for hurt feelings? The person who feels hurt or the person who's perceived to be hurting them? Is constructive conflict a good thing?* "I forget which podcast it was - maybe about Elm where they're trying to build a community. Maybe just to follow the best practices of the open source communities?" "When you have new people asking what you might call a stupid question, in some communities they're like 'that's a dumb question; go google it' and in other communities they help you figure it out." **"If you alienate people your community won't grow."** "One thing we can do is say 'That's a good thought, and this is why, and another way we can do it is like this.'" "Communicating in a better way." "Usually by you speaking up and sharing your idea, it spurs ideas in other people. That's sometimes what sparks the idea that was actually implemented. It got the thought process of the mob in line for solving the real problem."

"If you had more resources, you could just fork the project and start another project. It wasn't the implementation that caused conflict, it was the high level talk."

"If we do go the approach of 'just say no, just such them down' instead of more comforting things, it might be good to rotate people afterwards to help people feel better." "I see 'community manager' as a parallel."

"I wasn't happy with the choice to use Node, but I feel like it was a circumstance of the mob. It was a hack day. Not everyone knew the languages I wanted to use. It would have been better to use Scala, or Haskell, or Erlang, but there was the issue of bringing people up to speed and that conflicts with needing to get something done."

"I was unhappy we didn't use Java 8. And I got a preemptive shut down before I even brought it up." "Can we vote then?" "I'm not the only person who is going to come to the mob with opinion." "I think it's different for you because you're in a position of authority. If someone else had said that, we could have just said no way, but when you say it, it's different. *I think a person in a position of authority has to be careful what they say.* I think one thing to counter that is if we had more than one person in an equal level of authority." "I want to say that no one in the mob has more authority than anyone else, even if I try to make it look that way." "I think you can say that, but there's still going to be that underlying social factor because you're responsible for hirings, firings, raises, etc."

*What would you like to try differently? On a team level... For you personally...*

"I really want to try getting new tools. I want more collaborative editing, more collaborative driving, being able to hand off the driving easily - even if someone wants to jump in and just finish my sentence or a line of code." "We can do remote or control your screen or something." "Or commit more often and everybody can pull it down?" 

"I think it's totally worth it [to use tmux with multiple drivers] but what do you do when it's Java or Scala? Because then the best editor is IntelliJ or Eclipse."

"There's a problem with key mappings. If you had a quick way to change the key mappings."

"I wonder if having a standard tool for mobbing, and standard key bindings, would be worthwhile."

"I wonder if it would be a good idea to let the less experienced people drive next time. It'd be better for whoever is driving, and for whoever is explaining. I feel like explaining things helps me understand it better."

*What still has you puzzled? On a team level... For you personally...*

[On coming into the mob after it's started.] "By the time I'm here it's almost done. I don't know what we've done, what we've gone through, by that point. It's better than coming into the middle of a individual projects. There's a lot of people discussing, a group of people discussing together, much better than going and talking to people individually."

"When you get in a rhythm in a pair it's like the other person can finish your sentences for you. It'd be nice if you could do that in a mob."

"We have a variety of different languages that we're all skilled at, so depending on which language we choose to use, somebody's always going to feel excluded. I'm puzzled at how we can become super successful at mob programming when our skillsets vary so much."

*An additional note*

One member of the mob was not present for our retrospective. That person hadn't said anything for the last couple of hours of coding, which concerned me enough to ask about it after. Also, the last conversation had been with me, and that person expressed feeling shut down by my position of authority. Finally this person left during our hack day wrap up.

The next day, we spoke about what had happened and how it felt to each of us. It turned out that this person had experienced a serious relationship upset the night before and was emotionally drained. We discussed options for checking out of the group, and for participating passively, and the importance of trusting when someone in the mob chooses to do either of those things.

## 19 June 2015

Present were Jason, Julia, Michael, Kirsten, Nhat. Mobbed for 2 hours, target was Angular.js testing on the server using jsdom.

*What went well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"It was pretty cool that some of the boilerplate we had to do, Nhat could just rattle off the top of his head, where it would have taken me a half hour to figure it out."

"Maybe now we know that jsdom doesn't play well, maybe. We can move on, maybe, to benv."

"Our driver got called away to a meeting and we continued without missing a beat."

"My worst times to code are between 2 and 4:30 in the afternoon. I think it went better in a mob. I think it might be more productive than working individually in that slow period." "I think I like it in the afternoon for that too." 

"As the driver, more of my mental capacity was used keeping up with all the suggestions rather than trying to think of a solution of my own." "It was easier for me because I was the one who was trying things, rather than researching and thinking about what'll work."

*What didn't go well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"It's Friday afternoon. And we were all full from lunch. Plus it's a little warm in here."

*What would you like to try differently? On a team level... For you personally...*

"Mob in the morning? Because fresher? I'd like to see what happens."

"It'd be interesting to see when everyone is up to speed on a project, if everyone pulled the code down and instead of just researching they actually tried stuff out. Instead of researching and suggesting something to try, you can bring a solution."

*What still has you puzzled? On a team level... For you personally...*



## 18 June 2015

Present were Julia Gao, Jason Hill, Kirsten, Brannon Lucas, Ryan, Nhat, Matthew. Mobbed for about one hour. The target was testing React.js code with Mocha and jsdom.

*What went well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"I like being able to leave for coffee and come back."

"The ability for others to look ahead while she's working on a problem, so she can keep her focus." "With that, different people can pursue different avenues looking forward."

"Faster for me to resolve issues just because people are looking at different things, comparing stuff, instead of just me going back and forth. I might miss something."

"As someone who's not involved in the project at all, I found it informative to see how you're setting up the technology... It's nice to sit in on it without having to set up the code myself. I don't have to setup a project..."

"Exposed me to new technologies. I didn't know about jest or jsdom and now I know about it."

"It's nice to see these things all working together."

"Yes to all of the above (valuable, valued, good learning experience.)"

"I feel like I gained something."

"I feel like a lot of people helped today."

"I probably never would have dug into the source code for Jest or jsdom..."

*What didn't go well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"I started off with something I got stuck on. It didn't start smoothly. If we didn't get stuck on this we could have finished something else."

"Multiple people were pursuing multiple avenues. It felt like a lot of feedback, might have been confusing." "For me, I didn't feel overwhelmed." "Limiting the size of the mob will help with that too."

"I was feeling bad that I got stuck on this and asked other people to help." "Sometimes it's the dumb problems you need someone else's insight on."

"In the past I've felt like I had to justify dogpiling on a problem. From an outside perspective it looks like one person is working on a computer and everyone else is sitting around."

*What would you like to try differently? On a team level... For you personally...*

Maybe we could rotate drivers more frequently?

"Snacks would be good." "Yes, I second that!" "Beer might also make it better..."

"Mob programming as a drinking game."

"It'd be interesting to see how it goes with rotating drivers over a longer time, like three hours."

"I'd like to try switching projects. Try a couple hours on one, and then switch to another. Let someone else have their project worked on by the mob."

## 17 June 2015

Present were Julia Gao (primary driver), Michael Whitehead, Jason Hill, Cameron Shellum, Lakshmi Boyina, Arun Salimath (briefly), Rob Clausing (briefly), and Rob Martin. Mobbed for 2.5 hours. The target was learning to code with tests in React.js.

*What went well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"It was easier to find bugs. Especially like typos and stuff. Saved time on that part. Plus multiple people on the same problem. Especially while I'm learning."

"This is kinda a plus and a minus. A lot of feedback off comments and what everyone is thinking. Good because I could make multiple hops off of what people were saying. Bad because we were queuing up things to do." 

"I like that everyone could feed off other people's ideas. I think things queuing up was a good thing because working individually, it takes more time to think of all those ideas." "But for what to do next, how to choose? Just in the order people recommend them?" "I think the problem of which thing to try next is a good problem to have. Having a full queue is better than an empty queue."

"I liked how my activity level could go up or down, depending on whether I knew what to do or didn't know what to do, I could learn from other people."

"It let me know my team mates a little bit better."

"I didn't know anything about React when I sat down. I learned a lot more about React in 2.5 hours of mob programming than I would have on my own."

"Different people gave me different perspectives for looking at the problem. Fresh perspectives than what I would have thought of."

"I want to try it again."

*What didn't go well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"We got stuck on these little things. If we hadn't we could have been cruising along." "However, if you'd been doing it individually, you would have been stuck anyway." "We could have maybe split off."

*What would you like to try differently? On a team level... For you personally...*

"Maybe when we hit a problem, have someone split off to research and the mob can move onto something else."

"I'd like to see a time constraint so we can work on more than one person's problem. Like two hours on her problem then move to something else."

"If it was commonplace, it'd be no problem for me to say 'Let's form a mob on this.'"

*What still has you puzzled? On a team level... For you personally...*

"You can easily see how you're putting a lot of resources on one thing. It's good in a way but there could be questions asked like how are we going to get these other things done too? I have stuff I planned out to do this week."

"I just wanna try it again."
