# Mob Programming Retrospectives

## 17 June 2015

Present were Julia Gao (primary driver), Michael Whitehead, Jason Hill, Cameron Shellum, Lakshmi Boyina, Arun Salimath (briefly), Rob Clausing (briefly), and Rob Martin. The target was learning to code with tests in React.js.

*What went well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"It was easier to find bugs. Especially like typos and stuff. Saved time on that part. Plus multiple people on the same problem. Especially while I'm learning."

"This is kinda a plus and a minus. A lot of feedback off comments and what everyone is thinking. Good because I could make multiple hops off of what people were saying. Bad because we were queuing up things to do." 

"I like that everyone could feed off other people's ideas. I think things queuing up was a good thing because working individually, it takes more time to think of all those ideas." "But for what to do next, how to choose? Just in the order people recommend them?" "I think the problem of which thing to try next is a good problem to have. Having a full queue is better than an empty queue."

"I liked how my activity level could go up or down, depending on whether I knew what to do or didn't know what to do, I could learn from other people."

"It let me know my team mates a little bit better."

"I didn't know anything about React when I sat down. I learned a lot more about React in 2.5 hours of mob programming than I would have on my own."

"Different people gave me different perspectives for looking at the problem. Fresh perspectives than what I would have thought of."

"I want to try it again."

*What didn't go well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"We got stuck on these little things. If we hadn't we could have been cruising along." "However, if you'd been doing it individually, you would have been stuck anyway." "We could have maybe split off."

*What would you like to try differently? On a team level... For you personally...*

"Maybe when we hit a problem, have someone split off to research and the mob can move onto something else."

"I'd like to see a time constraint so we can work on more than one person's problem. Like two hours on her problem then move to something else."

"If it was commonplace, it'd be no problem for me to say 'Let's form a mob on this.'"

*What still has you puzzled? On a team level... For you personally...*

"You can easily see how you're putting a lot of resources on one thing. It's good in a way but there could be questions asked like how are we going to get these other things done too? I have stuff I planned out to do this week."

"I just wanna try it again."
