# Mob Programming Retrospectives


## 19 June 2015

Present were Jason, Julia, Michael, Kirsten, Nhat. Mobbed for 2 hours, target was Angular.js testing on the server using jsdom.

*What went well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"It was pretty cool that some of the boilerplate we had to do, Nhat could just rattle off the top of his head, where it would have taken me a half hour to figure it out."

"Maybe now we know that jsdom doesn't play well, maybe. We can move on, maybe, to benv."

"Our driver got called away to a meeting and we continued without missing a beat."

"My worst times to code are between 2 and 4:30 in the afternoon. I think it went better in a mob. I think it might be more productive than working individually in that slow period." "I think I like it in the afternoon for that too." 

"As the driver, more of my mental capacity was used keeping up with all the suggestions rather than trying to think of a solution of my own." "It was easier for me because I was the one who was trying things, rather than researching and thinking about what'll work."

*What didn't go well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"It's Friday afternoon. And we were all full from lunch. Plus it's a little warm in here."

*What would you like to try differently? On a team level... For you personally...*

"Mob in the morning? Because fresher? I'd like to see what happens."

"It'd be interesting to see when everyone is up to speed on a project, if everyone pulled the code down and instead of just researching they actually tried stuff out. Instead of researching and suggesting something to try, you can bring a solution."

*What still has you puzzled? On a team level... For you personally...*



## 18 June 2015

Present were Julia Gao, Jason Hill, Kirsten, Brannon Lucas, Ryan, Nhat, Matthew. Mobbed for about one hour. The target was testing React.js code with Mocha and jsdom.

*What went well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"I like being able to leave for coffee and come back."

"The ability for others to look ahead while she's working on a problem, so she can keep her focus." "With that, different people can pursue different avenues looking forward."

"Faster for me to resolve issues just because people are looking at different things, comparing stuff, instead of just me going back and forth. I might miss something."

"As someone who's not involved in the project at all, I found it informative to see how you're setting up the technology... It's nice to sit in on it without having to set up the code myself. I don't have to setup a project..."

"Exposed me to new technologies. I didn't know about jest or jsdom and now I know about it."

"It's nice to see these things all working together."

"Yes to all of the above (valuable, valued, good learning experience.)"

"I feel like I gained something."

"I feel like a lot of people helped today."

"I probably never would have dug into the source code for Jest or jsdom..."

*What didn't go well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"I started off with something I got stuck on. It didn't start smoothly. If we didn't get stuck on this we could have finished something else."

"Multiple people were pursuing multiple avenues. It felt like a lot of feedback, might have been confusing." "For me, I didn't feel overwhelmed." "Limiting the size of the mob will help with that too."

"I was feeling bad that I got stuck on this and asked other people to help." "Sometimes it's the dumb problems you need someone else's insight on."

"In the past I've felt like I had to justify dogpiling on a problem. From an outside perspective it looks like one person is working on a computer and everyone else is sitting around."

*What would you like to try differently? On a team level... For you personally...*

Maybe we could rotate drivers more frequently?

"Snacks would be good." "Yes, I second that!" "Beer might also make it better..."

"Mob programming as a drinking game."

"It'd be interesting to see how it goes with rotating drivers over a longer time, like three hours."

"I'd like to try switching projects. Try a couple hours on one, and then switch to another. Let someone else have their project worked on by the mob."

*What still has you puzzled? On a team level... For you personally...*

## 17 June 2015

Present were Julia Gao (primary driver), Michael Whitehead, Jason Hill, Cameron Shellum, Lakshmi Boyina, Arun Salimath (briefly), Rob Clausing (briefly), and Rob Martin. Mobbed for 2.5 hours. The target was learning to code with tests in React.js.

*What went well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"It was easier to find bugs. Especially like typos and stuff. Saved time on that part. Plus multiple people on the same problem. Especially while I'm learning."

"This is kinda a plus and a minus. A lot of feedback off comments and what everyone is thinking. Good because I could make multiple hops off of what people were saying. Bad because we were queuing up things to do." 

"I like that everyone could feed off other people's ideas. I think things queuing up was a good thing because working individually, it takes more time to think of all those ideas." "But for what to do next, how to choose? Just in the order people recommend them?" "I think the problem of which thing to try next is a good problem to have. Having a full queue is better than an empty queue."

"I liked how my activity level could go up or down, depending on whether I knew what to do or didn't know what to do, I could learn from other people."

"It let me know my team mates a little bit better."

"I didn't know anything about React when I sat down. I learned a lot more about React in 2.5 hours of mob programming than I would have on my own."

"Different people gave me different perspectives for looking at the problem. Fresh perspectives than what I would have thought of."

"I want to try it again."

*What didn't go well? On a team level... For you personally...*

"We got stuck on these little things. If we hadn't we could have been cruising along." "However, if you'd been doing it individually, you would have been stuck anyway." "We could have maybe split off."

*What would you like to try differently? On a team level... For you personally...*

"Maybe when we hit a problem, have someone split off to research and the mob can move onto something else."

"I'd like to see a time constraint so we can work on more than one person's problem. Like two hours on her problem then move to something else."

"If it was commonplace, it'd be no problem for me to say 'Let's form a mob on this.'"

*What still has you puzzled? On a team level... For you personally...*

"You can easily see how you're putting a lot of resources on one thing. It's good in a way but there could be questions asked like how are we going to get these other things done too? I have stuff I planned out to do this week."

"I just wanna try it again."
